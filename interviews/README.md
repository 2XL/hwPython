#### Leadership Principles

1. customer obsession
2. ownership
3. invent and simplify ->
4. are right, a lot -> instincts
5. learn and be curious
6. hire and develop the best -> career choice
7. think big
8. bias for action -> risk taking
9. frugality
A. earn trust
B. dive deep
C. have backbone; disagree and commit
D. deliver results ->
E. strive to be earth's best employer
F. success and scale bring broad responsabilty


application of the principles in previous working experience:
  -> take ownership of tasks
  -> invent and simplify
  -> deliver results 
  -> bias for action
  -> code reviews

### MAXIMUM 3 BROWSER SESSIONS RUNNING 

gg & have fun

dialogue -> clarification questions
  -> input
  -> time complexity O
    -> start brute and explain, refactoring
  -> architecture CAP
    -> abstractions for single component future implementation
  -> oop design patter
  -> pseudo_code ?
    -> showcase understanding of the problem
    -> work on each part
      -> optimize O
  -> memory intensive?
  -> cpu intensive?
  -> failure scenario / how you will test the code in production env
  -> code should run & peer coding with interviewer.
    -> syntactically correct
    -> readable and solves the problem
    -> library function?

#### tantes de empezar a codificar,
  -> plantear el problema 
  -> propuestas de solución
  -> disponer de pseudo codigo
  -> precondición postcondición asserts
  -> desarollar el codigo
  -> one or two questions ready
      -> prep interview
        -> research org
        -> prepare possible questions
        -> career progression
        -> training opportunities
        -> plan the route
        -> figure out what to wear

#### is there a bar raiser
  -> highest standards
