#### Leadership Principles

1. customer obsession
2. ownership
3. invent and simplify ->
4. are right, a lot -> instincts
5. learn and be curious
6. hire and develop the best -> career choice
7. think big
8. bias for action -> risk taking
9. frugality
A. earn trust
B. dive deep
C. have backbone; disagree and commit
D. deliver results ->
E. strive to be earth's best employer
F. success and scale bring broad responsibility


application of the principles in previous working experience: -> application one of each...git stat
  -> take ownership of tasks
  -> invent and simplify
  -> deliver results 
  -> bias for action
  -> code reviews

### MAXIMUM 3 BROWSER SESSIONS RUNNING 

gg & have fun

dialogue -> clarification questions
  -> input
  -> time complexity O
    -> start brute and explain, refactoring
  -> architecture CAP
    -> abstractions for single component future implementation
  -> oop design patter
  -> pseudo_code ?
    -> showcase understanding of the problem
    -> work on each part
      -> optimize O
  -> memory intensive?
  -> cpu intensive?
  -> failure scenario / how you will test the code in production env
  -> code should run & peer coding with interviewer.
    -> syntactically correct
    -> readable and solves the problem
    -> library function?

#### antes de empezar a codificar,
  -> plantear el problema 
    -> how to break down the cope problem
  -> propuestas de solución
  -> disponer de pseudo codigo
  -> precondición postcondición asserts
  -> desarollar el codigo
  -> one or two questions ready
      -> prep interview
        -> research org
        -> prepare possible questions
        -> career progression
        -> training opportunities
        -> plan the route
        -> figure out what to wear
#### is there a bar raiser
  -> highest standards
  -> 2 weeks 4 prepare
  -> dynamic programming? tree's...
      -> make your algorithm more efficient by storing intermediate result
      -> repetitive competitions
      -> recursion
      -> application
          -> prime numbers
          -> fibonacci
          -> mander
  -> data structures? heaps -> sorts -> complexity -> broad, quick, sort, do some tests, 
  -> writing prompt to explain the decisions taken
  -> operating systems
  -> distributed systems? 
  -> problem-solving session
  -> genuinely interested in your team
  -> what cool things you work on
  -> how was your career development over the years
  -> how do you feel like % supports you specifically through the pandemic period work-life balance 
  -> ask about REFLOW
  -> specific team
  -> maintainability and code modularity -> buying and selling in one function?


#### bible of coding interview
- CtCI
  - interview questions and detailed solutions
- PIE
  - detailed explanations
- Can you CODE?
  - find a friend
    - interviewee
      - ask questions to remove ambiguity
      - discuss high level approach
      - annunciate thought process as you code
    - interviewer p & p
      - pick: their head for what they know
      - poke: guide them if they get lost
    - what is the solution?
      - not the fastest 
      - not the most efficient
      - but the one the interviewer knows - based on the context
        - but not always
        - there comes us to propose show thoughts
          - recursive?
          - iterative?
        - is there any other way?
          - +% there is another way
          - mention unless you understand it well enough to teach
    - iterate x times each week to get fun to blow through all the questions

#### have the following questions prepared
1. tell me about the complex problems you have worked on -> deep dive
2. tell me about something interesting you've learned recently -> learn and be curious
3. when you had to pick between different technologies for a project -> how you differentiate & decision-making process - alright a lot
4. a time when you sacrificed short term goals for long term success -> your ownership of a problem
5. what's your most successful project? -> your standards, following updates
6. tell me about a time when you were wrong -> admit & grow from that experience - delivering results - why u get ask?
7. tell me the thought deadline you meet -> inspite the struggles - > deliver results
8. disagreement with your boss -> held your backbone -> I was not necessarily the right person -> interpersonal kill
